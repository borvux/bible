# Ephesians - Chapter 6

## Children and Parents (v1-4)

### Verse 1: The Command to Children

> "Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right."

The instruction for children is twofold: **obey** and **honor**.

  * **Obey**: This command reflects our relationship with God the Father. As we are His children, we should obey our earthly parents.
      * However, the phrase **"in the Lord"** implies a limit. A child is not required to obey a command that directly contradicts God's law (e.g., being told to lie or steal).
  * **Honor**: This is a broader, lifelong command that extends beyond simple obedience. To honor one's parents means to show them respect, deference, and care, even after you've grown up and left their home.

---

### Verses 2-3: The First Commandment with a Promise

> "...which is the first commandment with a promise—'so that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth.'"

This verse references **Deuteronomy 5:16**:

> "Honor your father and your mother, as the Lord your God has commanded you, so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the Lord your God is giving you."

  * This is the first of the Ten Commandments with a specific blessing attached.
  * It shows that God places a high value on the family structure and that respecting this order leads to a blessed and stable life and society.

---

### Verse 4: The Command to Fathers

> "Fathers, do not exasperate your children; instead, bring them up in the training and instruction of the Lord."

Just as children have responsibilities, so do parents. While the verse addresses "Fathers" (the primary authority figures in that culture), the principle applies to both parents. Their responsibility is also broken into two parts.

  * **1. "Do Not Exasperate Your Children"**

      * To **"exasperate"** means to provoke anger or frustration through harsh, unreasonable, or hypocritical behavior. This is a warning against misusing parental authority, which can happen through:
          * Constant criticism
          * Unrealistic expectations
          * Favoritism
          * Never being satisfied
          * Harsh discipline
      * Such actions can crush a child's spirit and push them away from God. Paul commands parents to be gentle and gracious in their authority.

  * **2. "Bring Them Up in the Training and Instruction of the Lord"**

      * Parents must actively nurture their children's spiritual lives.
          * **"Training"** (or "discipline") refers to the process of child-rearing—the actions, corrections, and habits that shape character.
          * **"Instruction"** refers to the verbal teaching and wisdom used to impart knowledge of God and His ways.
      * The goal of parenting, according to Paul, isn't just to produce a well-behaved child, but to nurture a disciple of Jesus.

### Summary: Children and Parents

In short, this passage outlines a relationship of mutual respect. Children are to honor and obey their parents, and parents are to lovingly and gently guide their children in the ways of God, creating a stable and nurturing environment where everyone can flourish.

## Slaves and Masters (v:5-9)

### The Historical Context: Slavery in the Roman Empire

It's crucial to understand that slavery in the first-century Roman world was different from the race-based chattel slavery of the American South.

  * It was **not primarily race-based**. People could become slaves through **war, debt, or being born into it**.
  * It was a deeply embedded social and economic institution, and the lives of slaves varied dramatically—from brutal manual labor to respected positions as doctors or household managers.
  * Slaves were considered property, but some had paths to freedom (a process called **manumission**).

Paul writes to a church within this system. His goal is not to start a political revolution but to transform human relationships from the inside out with the power of the gospel.

---

### The Command to Slaves (Verses 5-8)

> "Slaves, obey your earthly masters with respect and fear, and with sincerity of heart, just as you would obey Christ... Serve wholeheartedly, as if you were serving the Lord, not people, because you know that the Lord will reward each one for whatever good they do, whether they are slave or free."

This command is revolutionary because it reframes the slave's mindset.

  * **Reframes Their Service**: Paul tells them to work "as you would obey Christ." This elevates their mundane, often degrading, work to an act of worship. Their ultimate master is not human, but the Lord Jesus. This provides a dignity and purpose that Roman society denied them.
  * **Changes Their Motivation**: They are to work with **"sincerity of heart,"** not just when the master is watching, but wholeheartedly as a service to God.
  * **Promises a Divine Reward**: In a system where they might never be recognized, Paul promises that the Lord sees their work and **will reward them**. This promise of ultimate, divine justice subverts the injustice of their earthly situation and declares that their status as a slave is irrelevant to their eternal worth.

---

### The Command to Masters (Verse 9)

> "And masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Do not threaten them, since you know that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him."

This command was arguably even more shocking and counter-cultural.

  * **"Treat your slaves in the same way"**: Masters are to have the same mindset of sincere, wholehearted service toward their slaves. This flattens the harsh social hierarchy by establishing a mutual obligation to serve one another under God.
  * **"Do not threaten them"**: This directly attacks the primary tool of control in a master-slave relationship: fear and intimidation. Masters are commanded to give up coercion and lead with respect.
  * **Levels the Playing Field**: The reason is profound: **both have the same Master in heaven, and He shows no favoritism.** Paul tells the master that before God, he stands on the exact same level as his slave. Both are equally accountable to God, who judges them by their actions, not their social status.

---

### Summary: Slaves and Masters

While Paul does not explicitly command the abolition of slavery here, his instructions completely redefine the master-slave relationship. By grounding it in mutual accountability to Christ, he plants the seeds of equality and dignity that would ultimately undermine the moral foundations of the institution. He commands both slaves and masters to see each other not as property and owner, but as spiritual equals and siblings in Christ.

## The Armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-19)

### The Spiritual Battle (Verses 10-13)

The Christian life involves not just battles against the flesh but spiritual battles as well. Since these battles are spiritual, our weapons must also be spiritual. The "armor" represents the character and actions of a person living in a close relationship with God.

---

### The Belt of Truth (Verse 14)

A belt was the foundational piece of a Roman soldier's equipment; it held everything else together.

* For the believer, **truth** is what holds your spiritual life together. This means living with integrity and honesty, and grounding your life in the truth of God and His Word.

* So if we question what God says, how can we stand firm in the face of temptation and evil?

---

### The Breastplate of Righteousness (Verse 14)

The breastplate protected a soldier's heart and other vital organs.

* For the believer, this is the **righteousness** that comes from Christ. It's not our own good deeds, but the righteousness of Jesus that protects our hearts from the accusations and condemnation of the enemy.

---

### Feet Fitted with the Gospel of Peace (Verse 15)

A soldier's shoes (hobnailed sandals) gave them stability and readiness to move.

* For the believer, having your feet fitted with the gospel of **peace** means having the stability, confidence, and readiness that comes from knowing you are at peace with God through Jesus. It keeps you firm and steady in a chaotic world.

* We can live peacefully knowing God shows favour to those who follow him, instead of having to question or worry or face the wrath of God, which is a consequence of not having faith.

---

### The Shield of Faith (Verse 16)

The large Roman shield could extinguish flaming arrows.

* For the believer, **faith** is trust in God and His promises. It acts as a shield to extinguish the "flaming arrows" of the enemy, which are things like doubt, fear, temptation, and lies.

* Temptation often preys upon our insecurities and doubts, but it is impossible to be tempted if you are confident in your fiath in God and his promises to us.

---

### The Helmet of Salvation (Verse 17)

The helmet protected the soldier's head, their command center.

* For the believer, the helmet is the assurance of your **salvation**. Protecting your mind with the confidence that you belong to God guards you against despair and doubt about your ultimate security in Christ.

* Everything becomes clearer when you accept God into your life. It gives us more perspective, so we can spot sin from miles away.

---

### The Sword of the Spirit (Verse 17)

The sword was the soldier's primary offensive weapon.

* For the believer, the sword is the **Word of God** (the Bible). It is a spiritual weapon used to fight against temptation (as Jesus did in the wilderness) and to speak God's truth into any situation.

* As Christians we **NEED** to know bible verses so that we can live by them and recite them when necessary.

---

### Prayer in the Spirit (Verse 18)

Prayer is the constant communication that keeps a soldier connected to their command center. Armor is useless without this connection.

* Paul urges believers to **pray** on all occasions and to stay alert, not just for themselves, but for all other believers, keeping the lines of communication with God open.
